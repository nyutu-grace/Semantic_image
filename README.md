Semantic Image and Text Alignment: Automated Storyboard Synthesis for Digital Advertising

### Business objective  

The aim of this project is to harness recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, particularly through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), to transform textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets into detailed storyboards. These technologies facilitate the creation of dynamic content that bridges the gap between textual concepts and visual storytelling. 

The ultimate objective is to develop a machine learning framework that can seamlessly convert textual ad descriptions into detailed, visually compelling storyboards that accurately reflect the intended user flow and narrative of an advertising campaign.
